// deliverables (v1.17.0) — declared-deliverable verification.
//
// A slice-stop (the same ritual a spawned/sub-worker runs on its way out)
// declares the files it produced via `--targets`. The D2 git cross-check
// already catches the inverse — files changed but NOT declared. This catches
// the hollow claim: a target the agent *named* that has no evidence of
// existing. An agent that reports writing `src/foo.ts` when no such file is on
// disk (and git never saw it) produced a phantom deliverable; surfacing that
// is the point. Inspired by oh-my-claudecode's verify-deliverables, kept
// files-only and WARN-only — it records and reports, it never blocks the stop.
//
// A target counts as verified if it exists on disk OR appears in git's changed
// set (so a legitimately deleted/renamed file isn't a false positive).
