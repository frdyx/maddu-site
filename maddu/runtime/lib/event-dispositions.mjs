// event-dispositions.mjs (DD1, roadmap #3) — the definition-site disposition
// registry. EVERY event type defined in spine.mjs EVENT_TYPES carries a verdict
// here, so a type can never be added without a decision and the dead-domain
// surface (F3) can never silently grow. The `event-dispositions-complete` gate
// holds this registry in 1:1 parity with EVENT_TYPES and requires a reason on
// every non-active entry; insights derives DORMANT_BY_DESIGN from it (single
// source of truth — collapsing the three previously-disconnected surfaces).
//
// disp:
//   'active'  — fires in normal operation (load-bearing or occasional).
//   'dormant' — defined but fires only under a specific posture/edge. reason
//               REQUIRED. Reads as dormant (not dead) in `maddu insights`.
//   'plugin'  — owned by an optional plugin (off in core). reason = plugin name.
//
// Seeded 2026-06-30 from the cross-project audit: the 34 then-dead core types
// are accepted as dormant-with-reason (see docs/audit/LEDGER.md F3). To retire a
// type instead, remove it from EVENT_TYPES (the gate then drops it here too).
