# Hard rules

Máddu enforces nine invariants. `maddu doctor` verifies them on every install and every upgrade.

## Scope: these rules govern Máddu, not your product

**Read this before reading the rules.** Every invariant below is about **how
Máddu itself is built** — Máddu's own orchestration code that lives under
`.maddu/` and `maddu/` (the CLI, the bridge server `maddu/runtime/server.js`,
the cockpit SPA, the harness scripts). They describe the framework's
construction, and `maddu doctor` only ever scans those framework files.

**They do NOT constrain the product / host project you are building *with*
Máddu.** The application in the rest of the repo is yours: it may use any
provider SDK (`openai`, `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, …), any hosted backend, any
database (SQLite, Postgres, a hosted DB), OAuth flows and encrypted token
tables, cron jobs, and real publishing/posting engines — whatever the product
requires. That is governed by the **project's own** `CLAUDE.md` at the repo
root, not by Máddu. Máddu *orchestrates* the work (sessions, lanes, the spine,
review gates); it never dictates the product's architecture.

So "Máddu's rules forbid token storage / provider SDKs / hosted backends" is
**only** a statement about Máddu's framework layer. It is never a reason for an
agent to stub, mock, or cripple the thing it is shipping. When a product
feature needs a real integration, build the real integration — and if you want
Máddu to help reach an external capability, that's what `maddu mcp` is for.

When phrasing below says "app code", it means **Máddu's** app (the bridge and
cockpit), not your application.

---

These rules are non-negotiable *for the framework* because each one prevents a specific failure mode observed in prior agent-orchestration systems we studied (AionUi, Hermes, and others — see [`research/`](research/)). A repo whose **Máddu layer** violates any of them is not a sound Máddu install.

## 1. Files-only state

Every piece of state Máddu writes is one of:

- An append-only NDJSON event in `.maddu/events/`.
- A JSON projection in `.maddu/state/`, rebuildable from the spine.
- A typed Markdown or JSON definition in `.maddu/{lanes,briefs,wiki,harness}/`.

No SQLite. No embedded DB. No hosted DB. No binary blobs masquerading as state. If you can't `cat` it and understand it, Máddu didn't write it.

**Why:** Auditability with `cat`. Backup with `cp`. Portability with `git`. Recovery without specialized tooling.

## 2. Append-only event spine

`.maddu/events/*.ndjson` is the single source of truth. Projections rebuild from it. No projection is authoritative. If the spine and a projection disagree, the spine wins.

**Why:** One home for truth. Every state question reduces to "replay the spine."

**Derived ≠ projected.** A projection *summarizes* events that exist in the spine — it never *infers* state that has no anchor event. If the system makes a decision (auto-approving a tool call, auto-firing a schedule, auto-releasing a lane), that decision must be appended to the spine as its own event, with a `triggered_by` field pointing at the rule that produced it. Synthesizing decisions at read time would break audit immutability (a projector change could rewrite historical decisions) and cross-machine determinism (a fresh replay on another machine could land different outcomes). The bridge handles auto-approvals via `lib/approvals.mjs::maybeAutoDecide`; the projector consumes the resulting `APPROVAL_DECIDED` events but never manufactures them.

**Verifiable, not just declared.** The spine's status as source of truth is a promise the framework makes — and one it must let the operator check. `maddu spine verify` walks every segment under `.maddu/events/` and confirms: NDJSON parseability (distinguishing a torn final line from interior corruption), event-id uniqueness, segment continuity, timestamp monotonicity within each segment, referential integrity across types (every `APPROVAL_DECIDED` resolves to a real `APPROVAL_REQUESTED`; every `LANE_RELEASED` traces to a matching `LANE_CLAIMED`, with never-claimed releases failing and duplicate releases warning; every `SESSION_CLOSED` references a registered session; etc.), and — since v1.14.0 — **forward chain-integrity**: each event carries a `prev_hash` (SHA-256 of the preceding event's stored line), and the verifier recomputes the chain and flags the first link that doesn't match, so an after-the-fact rewrite of interior history is detectable, not silent. The chain is forward-only (events written before v1.14.0 are unchained legacy and skipped) and tamper-evidence is **reported, never auto-repaired**. `maddu doctor` calls into the verifier on every run (up to a 50k-event cap, above which the operator runs `verify` manually) so a green doctor report is a real statement about the framework's bedrock. The verifier is strictly read-only — if it flags an issue, the operator decides how to address it (manual edit + slice-stop, checkpoint rollback, etc.). No auto-repair, ever.

## 3. No hosted backends

Provider APIs (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google) are called directly from local subprocess workers. Máddu has no SaaS counterpart. No telemetry beacon, no relay, no "Máddu Cloud."

**Why:** Local-first means local-first. The framework spawns no models, stores no secrets, calls no clouds on the operator's behalf.

## 4. No broad new dependencies

Node stdlib where possible. PKCE uses `crypto.randomBytes` + `createHash('sha256')`. HTTP uses `node:http`. JSON is JSON. The total `dependencies` block in any installed Máddu repo's `package.json` adjuncts should be empty or contain only narrowly-scoped utilities the operator added themselves.

**Why:** Supply-chain integrity. Reproducibility across Node versions. Faster cold installs. No surprise transitive vulnerabilities.

## 5. No provider SDKs in app code

The bridge server, cockpit, and harness scripts never `import 'anthropic'`, `'openai'`, `'@google/generative-ai'`, or equivalents. Provider calls happen exclusively in worker subprocesses (`claude exec`, `codex exec`, future runtimes) which Máddu spawns with credentials injected at spawn time.

**Why:** The cockpit is a UI for orchestration, not a model client. Keeping SDKs out of app code prevents accidental key leakage, makes auditing trivial, and lets workers evolve independently.

## 6. No token export

OAuth tokens live in OS-appropriate device-bound paths:
- Linux/macOS: `~/.config/maddu/auth/`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\maddu\auth\`

`maddu export` scrubs them from portable bundles. `maddu import` refuses to overwrite existing tokens. There is no "sync tokens across machines" feature, by design.

**Why:** Tokens are device credentials, not portable identity.

## 7. Three-layer brand boundary

Three brand domains exist in any Máddu installation:

1. **Framework shell brand** — what the cockpit looks like. Owned by Máddu. Tokens in `maddu/cockpit/tokens.css`. Typography: IBM Plex Sans / Plex Sans Condensed / Plex Mono. Aesthetic: Scandinavian tech, sci-fi dark noir.
2. **App brand** — the brand of whatever application the host repo is building. Owned by the project. Lives wherever the project keeps app brand data.
3. **Content brand** — per-campaign, per-asset, per-output brand. Owned by the project's content authors.

These never mix. Cockpit tokens never leak into app brand. App brand never leaks into content. Content brand never leaks into cockpit. This boundary is enforced **by construction**: the framework ships only the cockpit shell brand (`maddu/cockpit/tokens.css`) and never writes app or content brand. App and content brand are project-owned with no fixed framework path, so there is no runtime doctor gate for this rule — it is traced as *enforced-by-construction* in [39-rule-gate-traceability.md](39-rule-gate-traceability.md).

**Why:** Prior systems (notably AionUi) repeatedly leaked cockpit aesthetics into user-saved brand profiles. The boundary makes that impossible by construction.

## 8. Lane ownership

Before editing a file area, an agent claims a lane in `.maddu/lanes/claims.json`. No two agents may hold the same lane concurrently. Cross-lane work requires explicit handoff through the mailbox bus (`.maddu/lanes/<lane>/mailbox.ndjson`), not shared mutation.

**Why:** Multi-agent work without conflict requires an explicit coordination primitive. Lanes + mailboxes are it.

---

## 9. Every auto-trigger crosses the gauntlet *(permanent as of v0.19.0)*

No command that mutates spine, state, or workspace files may auto-fire (cron, schedule, daemon, retry loop) without:

1. A `tier: 'mutating'` entry in `commands/_tiers.mjs`.
2. An explicit allowlist entry in `<repo>/.maddu/config/triggers.json` naming the command.
3. A respected cooldown window since the most recent `TRIGGER_FIRED` for the same trigger id.

Read-only commands (tier `'read-only'`) may auto-fire freely. Any auto-trigger that succeeds emits a `TRIGGER_FIRED` event with `triggered_by` provenance. Auto-actions that should run only when an agent is present land in the pending-actions queue via `PENDING_ACTION_ENQUEUED` and are surfaced to the next agent through `maddu brief --drain`.

**Why:** A spine that mutates on its own without an operator-visible audit trail is a spine an agent can't trust. The gauntlet ensures every auto-mutation has (a) a typed command identity, (b) an operator's signature in `triggers.json`, and (c) a recorded firing event. Pre-Phase-4 schedules could fire any command silently — that footgun is now closed.

**Status:** permanent (promoted v0.19.0). Two v0.18 slices, the v0.19 Phase 5 stress harness scenario `advisor-cannot-claim`, and the upgrade-matrix coverage all produced zero false-positive refusals on legitimate workflows. The gauntlet stays.

The `command-tier-discipline` built-in gate enforces (1). The `schedule.tick` evaluateCommandTrigger helper enforces (2) and (3) at fire-time. `verify-spine` accepts `TRIGGER_FIRED`, `PENDING_ACTION_ENQUEUED`, and `PENDING_ACTION_DRAINED` events and checks the enqueued↔drained referential integrity.

## Do-not-copy reference

The patterns below were observed in studied systems and are explicitly forbidden in Máddu. `maddu doctor` watches for them.

| Pattern | Source observed | Violates rule |
|---|---|---|
| SQLite for feature state | AionUi `better-sqlite3`, Hermes `state.db` | #1 files-only |
| `localStorage` for non-trivial UI state | AionUi renderer | #1 files-only |
| Electron + Rust standalone backend | AionUi | #4 no broad deps |
| Native provider SDKs in core runtime | Hermes `run_agent.py` (Anthropic, Bedrock transports) | #5 no SDK in app code |
| **Cloud gateway** for Telegram/Slack/Discord (hosted webhook relay) | Hermes `gateway/` | #3 hosted backends, #6 token export, #7 brand boundary |
| Pastebin upload (`/debug share`) | Hermes | #3 no hosted backends |
| Google Desktop OAuth for built-in agent | AionUi | #6 no token-leaking flows |
| API-key import during migration | Hermes OpenClaw migration | #6 no token export |
| Remote WebUI / browser-based agent runtime | AionUi optional mode | #3 local-only |
| Broad optional extras (`google`, `homeassistant`, `sms`, `youtube`) | Hermes | #4 no broad deps |
| Provider configs written into installed CLI backends from renderer/app state | AionUi `McpService` | #5 (bridge-owned, not app-owned) |

### What is and isn't a "cloud gateway"

The first row of the table above prohibits the **Hermes pattern**: a hosted
service that receives webhooks from Telegram / Slack / Discord, holds bot
tokens for many users, and relays messages between agents. That violates
hard rules #3 (hosted backend), #6 (token export), and #7 (brand boundary
— the gateway dictates how messages render across platforms, blurring
cockpit / app / content layers).

It does **not** prohibit chat integrations as a category. The integrations
shipped in v0.9.0 (Telegram) and v0.10.0 (Discord, Email) explicitly take
the *opposite* shape from the Hermes gateway, and `maddu doctor` will not
flag them. Specifically, every Máddu integration must:

1. **Run locally.** All polling and sending happens inside
   `runtime/server.js` on the operator's machine. There is no public webhook
   URL anywhere.
2. **Use the provider's API directly.** Telegram via long-poll
   (`getUpdates`); Discord via REST `POST /channels/{id}/messages`; Email
   via direct SMTP. Built-in `fetch` and `node:tls` only — no provider
   SDK (`python-telegram-bot`, `discord.js`, `nodemailer`, etc.).
3. **Store tokens device-bound.** Every credential lives under
   `%APPDATA%\maddu\auth\*.json` (Windows) or `~/.config/maddu/auth/`
   (POSIX), per the existing `auth.mjs` contract. The HTTP surface returns
   the masked tail (`****1234`) only.
4. **Be off by default.** Enable is refused until a token AND a non-empty
   allowlist (chat ids / channel ids / recipient addresses) are both
   configured.
5. **Allowlist senders or recipients.** Telegram drops content from
   non-allowlisted chat ids silently; Discord refuses to post to non-
   allowlisted channels; Email refuses to send to non-allowlisted
   recipients. Re-checked at both queue-time and send-time.
6. **Never run inbound-as-command.** Messages from allowlisted senders are
   appended to `.maddu/chats/<provider>/*.ndjson` and emit a typed event,
   but no action is taken on the content. "Approve via Telegram" or
   similar inbound→action mappings are a separate explicit-opt-in slice
   gated by the Enforcer, never default behavior.

The operator-visible trade these integrations require — and the
Settings panel surfaces this verbatim — is that **message content travels
through the provider's servers**. The hard rules protect feature state
and tokens; they don't pretend a chat platform doesn't see its own
messages. That trade is documented at point of enable, and the bridge
remains off until the operator accepts it by enabling it.
