# Máddu docs

**The Source of local truth.**

Máddu (North Sámi for *root, origin, ancestry*; pronounced **MOD-doo**) is a project-agnostic agent-orchestration framework. It installs into any git repo with one command, drops a small Node bridge and a single-page cockpit, and stores all state as files under `.maddu/`. No SQLite, no hosted backend, no provider SDK *in Máddu's own code*.

> These constraints describe how **Máddu itself** is built (the framework layer — `.maddu/` + `maddu/`). They do **not** apply to the product you build *with* Máddu — your app may use any database, backend, SDK, or token storage it needs. See [hard-rules.md](hard-rules.md#scope-these-rules-govern-máddu-not-your-product).

Current version: **v1.92.1** ([changelog](../CHANGELOG.md)) — newest: **earned autonomy** (v1.92.0, operator-directed) — `maddu autonomy` grades each lane's earned trust deterministically from the verified record (Wilson lower bound over witnessed-clean vs dirty slice outcomes, 3-rung ladder, daily clean-credit cap) and **recommends, never applies,** governance-tier changes; muted while any phase is active; surfaced in `orient`, `governance show`, and the cockpit ([47-earned-autonomy.md](47-earned-autonomy.md)). Before that, the **governance arc** (v1.87.0→v1.91.0, all shipped 2026-07-03): `maddu ci` — a headless, LLM-free gate rail with a churn-proof pinned exit contract (`ci pin`; exit 1 only on gates *you* required — see [46-ci.md](46-ci.md)); the **completion-claim gate** — the `learn scan` heuristic (hedged "done" claims joined against *observed* proof, never self-report) surfaced warn-tier at every slice-stop ([37-failure-learning.md](37-failure-learning.md)); the **pre-compaction checkpoint** — a `PreCompact` hook writes `COMPACTION_CHECKPOINT` to the spine before Claude Code compacts its context, `orient` auto-announces what survived, fails open by design ([44-session-hooks.md](44-session-hooks.md)); **vendor-memory interop** — `learn sync --from-claude-memory` imports Claude Code's auto-memory as provenance-carrying facts, import-only and content-hash-deduped; and **sterile phases** — `phase set --tier` escalates effective governance for exactly that window, escalation-only ([30-governance-tiers.md](30-governance-tiers.md)). The canonical category statement lives in [45-category.md](45-category.md): **local-first cooperative agent governance** — the agent calls Máddu; Máddu never sits in the request path and never touches your keys. Earlier milestones (v1.19.0→v1.86.0): the dogfooded architecture refactor (server 2 705→~1 060 lines, cockpit decomposed to a composition root + 16 modules, docs single-sourced and **generated**, `maddu architecture` contract + structural-mass ratchet), the fleet delivery arc (`fleet` view + staged `fleet upgrade --plan/--apply`, halt-on-red), lesson federation, the outcome ledger, governance budget, and the cost-budget gate. 68 verbs, all classified agent vs operator; `maddu audit` 16/16.

## Zero learning curve (v0.18)

Inside Claude Code or Codex CLI you can type slash commands directly:

```
/maddu-autopilot ship the login form    # end-to-end task
/maddu-status                           # what's going on
/maddu-help                             # full roster
/maddu-cost                             # token / call rollup
```

Or just type natural language — the agent classifies the intent and
dispatches the matching slash command (and tells you which one).
Full reference: [22-slash-commands.md](22-slash-commands.md) +
[23-natural-language-routing.md](23-natural-language-routing.md).
The verbose `maddu <cmd>` CLI stays first-class for scripts and CI.

## 60-second overview

- One bridge on `127.0.0.1:4177` (`maddu start`) serves a static cockpit and a small HTTP API.
- One append-only NDJSON event spine under `.maddu/events/` is the single source of truth. Every JSON file in `.maddu/state/` is a rebuildable projection of the spine.
- Agents register **sessions**, claim **lanes** (mutually-exclusive work areas), do **slices** of work, and end each slice with a structured **slice-stop**. Slice-stops feed the hindsight extractor, which distills reusable **skills** and **memory** facts.
- Cross-lane coordination flows through per-lane **mailboxes**, not shared mutation. Sensitive operations route through the **approvals** ledger.
- Provider calls happen exclusively in spawned **runtime** subprocesses (Claude Code, Codex, etc.). Tokens are device-bound; nothing leaves the machine.

| 39 | [39-rule-gate-traceability.md](39-rule-gate-traceability.md) | Hard-rule ↔ gate traceability matrix — every rule maps to an enforcing gate (or documented construction); every gate traces to a rule or coherence concern. Kept honest by `maddu audit`. *(v1.13.0)* |
| 40 | [40-architecture-drift.md](40-architecture-drift.md) | `maddu architecture` — declared architecture contract vs the real import graph → drift (forbidden edges, cycles, undeclared areas); mermaid diagram; `architecture-drift` gate with the `failOn` baseline ratchet. *(v1.18.0)* |

Deterministic per-turn tag + optional cheap-worker flag narrative; cockpit Focus route; `focus-ledger-coherent` gate. |
| 44 | [44-session-hooks.md](44-session-hooks.md) | `maddu hooks` — session discipline by default: wire Claude Code `SessionStart`/`SessionEnd`/`PreCompact` hooks so every session auto-registers + records to the spine, and checkpoints the durable record before every context compaction (v1.89.0); the active-session resolver flows that one session into `lane claim`/`slice-stop` with no `--session`/env. Idempotent, surgical, host-file (`.claude/settings.json`), opt-in at `init`. *(v1.74.0)* |
| 45 | [45-category.md](45-category.md) | The category, canonically defined: **local-first cooperative agent governance** — each word's operational meaning ("delete `.maddu/` and Máddu is gone"; the agent calls Máddu, never proxied), the by-contrast table (control plane / gateway / tracing / memory / durable-execution), the interop line (platforms govern *which* agents run; Máddu governs *how* they work), and why the nearby names are already taken. Every other surface quotes this page. |
| 46 | [46-ci.md](46-ci.md) | `maddu ci` — the headless, LLM-free gate rail for CI: run every deterministic gate (+ a learn-scan advisory), exit nonzero ONLY on gates the repo pinned as required (`ci pin`), so framework gate-set churn never changes a consumer's CI verdict until they opt in. `--strict` for any-fail-is-red; auto GitHub Actions annotations + job summary. *(v1.87.0)* |
| 47 | [47-earned-autonomy.md](47-earned-autonomy.md) | `maddu autonomy` — earned autonomy: a deterministic per-lane trust score over the verified record (Wilson lower bound over witnessed-clean vs dirty slice outcomes, 3-rung ladder, daily clean-credit cap) that **recommends, never applies,** governance-tier changes. Muted while any phase is active; surfaced in `orient`, `governance show`, and the cockpit next to the tier it informs. *(v1.92.0)* |
| 48 | [48-otel-export.md](48-otel-export.md) | `maddu export --otel` — read-only spine → OpenTelemetry logs (OTLP/JSON): stable dotted event names (`maddu.lane.claimed`), the published contract's `summary` as the log body and its version on the scope, flat `maddu.*` attributes, pinned WARN/ERROR severity for gate-fail/hard-catch/forced events. stdout by default or POST to a collector you name per-invocation — no stored creds, no daemon, no SDK in core. *(#12b)* |

Reference docs that are not in the numbered series:

- [`charter.md`](charter.md) — the north star: mission, the 8+1 invariants,
  and the one canonical flow. Read this when any doc or feature seems to
  disagree with itself — the charter is the intent.
- [`installation.md`](installation.md) — install requirements and steps.
- [`hard-rules.md`](hard-rules.md) — the 8 invariants in full, plus the
  do-not-copy reference (including the distinction between forbidden
  cloud-gateway chat bridges and the local long-poll / outbound-only
  integrations that ship in v0.9.0+).
- [`DESIGN-SYSTEM.md`](DESIGN-SYSTEM.md) — the canonical reference for
  every brand token, component anatomy, motion principle, layout pose,
  and accessibility commitment. Source of truth for both `cockpit.css`
  and the marketing video.
- [`lanes.md`](lanes.md) — default lane catalog.
- [`upgrade-policy.md`](upgrade-policy.md) — what `maddu upgrade` touches.
- [`event-schema.md`](event-schema.md) — the published spine event contract:
  the envelope, the semver rules, and the per-type `data` schema for every
  event. Generated from `event-schema.mjs`; the machine-readable JSON Schema is
  [`event-schema.json`](event-schema.json).

## Where to go next

If you have never run Máddu before, read [01-getting-started.md](01-getting-started.md). It walks through install, boot, your first session, and a hello-world slice in under ten minutes.

If you want the mental model first, read [02-concepts.md](02-concepts.md).

If you want a reference, [03-cli-reference.md](03-cli-reference.md) and [05-bridge-endpoints.md](05-bridge-endpoints.md) are the complete surfaces.
