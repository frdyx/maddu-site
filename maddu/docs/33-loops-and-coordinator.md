# 33. Loops and coordinator

Two related but distinct autonomy primitives:

- **Loops** (`maddu loop ralph`, `maddu loop plan`) — single-lane
  persistent iteration on one task.
- **Coordinator** (`maddu coordinator <plan-id>`) — multi-phase plan
  walking, one lane per phase.

Both are stdlib + `child_process.spawn` — no provider SDKs, no
Claude-Code-specific affordances.

## Loops (Phase 6)

Every iteration is a real slice with audit trail:

```
LOOP_STARTED             { loopId, kind, goal, maxIter, cooldownMs }
LOOP_ITERATION_STARTED   { loopId, kind, iter }
LOOP_ITERATION_COMPLETED { loopId, kind, iter, ok, signature, summary }
LOOP_HALTED              { loopId, kind, iter, reason, signature? }
LOOP_COMPLETED           { loopId, kind, iter, summary }
```

Stuck-detection: two consecutive failures with identical signatures →
`LOOP_HALTED reason: stuck-detection`. Max iter + cooldown come from
the governance tier ([governance tiers](30-governance-tiers.md)):

| Mode      | maxIter | cooldownMs |
|---|---|---|
| strict    | 3       | 10000      |
| standard  | 5       | 5000       |
| relaxed   | 10      | 1000       |

### Ralph

```bash
maddu loop ralph --goal "fix tsc errors" \
  --iterate "npm run codegen" \
  --verify  "npm test"
```

`verify` exit=0 ⇒ ok; non-zero ⇒ fail (and gets its tail captured into
the signature for stuck-detection).

**Verify-contract guarantees** *(locked in v1.1.1)*:

| verify outcome                               | loop result                                    |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| exit=0                                       | `LOOP_COMPLETED` at iter=1                     |
| non-zero, identical signature twice in a row | `LOOP_HALTED reason: stuck-detection`           |
| non-zero, distinct signature each iteration  | `LOOP_HALTED reason: max-iter-reached`          |

A synthetic stress-harness scenario (`ralph-always-fail-halts`) exercises runLoop directly with in-process verify callbacks to lock the contract against regression. If the operator-supplied `--verify "<cmd>"` looks like it "always passes" when it shouldn't, double-check that the shell expansion preserves the exit code — single-quoted JS scripts inside `cmd.exe /c` on Windows can be interpreted very differently than under POSIX shells.

For agent-written project code, prefer the adaptive project-test verifier when
the repo has more than one test shape:

```bash
maddu loop ralph --goal "fix tests until green" \
  --verify "maddu test --profile quick --bail"
```

That keeps Ralph's loop bounded to the project's discovered test contract,
prints stable failing test ids, and leaves test creation suggest-only.

### Plan-loop

```bash
maddu loop plan --plan pln_2026... --max-iter 8
```

Same iteration discipline, but the loop's goal is derived from the
named plan; the iteration carries `triggered_by.planId` lineage so
the slice-stop ritual feeds the plan auto-revision pathway.

## Coordinator (Phase 7)

The coordinator is the missing portability piece. Before v1.1.0,
multi-phase autonomous coordinators were invoked through Claude Code's
`Agent` tool — Claude-Code-specific. The Máddu-native coordinator
works with any runtime.

```bash
maddu coordinator <plan-id>                     # via configured runtime
maddu coordinator <plan-id> --dry-run           # each phase succeeds (smoke test)
maddu coordinator <plan-id> --synthetic-cmd "<bash>"  # shell mode
maddu coordinator <plan-id> --runtime claude-code     # named runtime
```

### Mechanics

For each open phase:

1. Spawn a subprocess via `child_process.spawn` (no shell). Pass env
   vars: `MADDU_COORDINATOR_PLAN_ID`, `MADDU_COORDINATOR_PHASE`,
   `MADDU_COORDINATOR_ID`, `MADDU_COORDINATOR_ITER`, plus the operator's
   `MADDU_SESSION_ID`.
2. The initial prompt is the phase's `intent` from `state.json`.
3. 5-iter cap per phase. Stuck-detection (2x identical fail signature)
   halts cleanly with `reason: phase-iteration-cap`.
4. Phase complete → emits `PLAN_PHASE_COMPLETED` (Phase 5 auto-refreshes
   plan artifacts).
5. Cooldown between iterations reads from governance tier.

### Events

```
COORDINATOR_STARTED         { coordinatorId, planId, runtime, dryRun }
COORDINATOR_PHASE_STARTED   { coordinatorId, planId, phase, intent }
COORDINATOR_PHASE_COMPLETED { coordinatorId, planId, phase }
COORDINATOR_HALTED          { coordinatorId, planId, phase, reason, signature?, exitCode? }
COORDINATOR_COMPLETED       { coordinatorId, planId, phaseCount }
```

### Slash command

```
/maddu-coordinate <plan-id> [--dry-run | --synthetic-cmd "..."]
```

## When to use which

| Scenario | Use |
|---|---|
| "fix tsc errors until clean" | `maddu loop ralph` |
| "walk plan X through all phases" | `maddu coordinator X` |
| "implement TODO list across audit→build→verify" | plan + coordinator |
| "retry project tests until pass" | `maddu loop ralph --verify "maddu test --profile quick --bail"` |
| "manual phase progression" | `maddu plan complete-phase` |

## Gates

- **`loop-iteration-audit`** (safety) — every `LOOP_STARTED` has a
  matching `LOOP_COMPLETED` or `LOOP_HALTED`.
- **`loop-cooldown-respected`** (warn) — failing-iteration gaps honor
  the tier-default cooldown (200ms tolerance).
- **`coordinator-phase-coherent`** (safety) — every
  `COORDINATOR_PHASE_STARTED` has a matching `_PHASE_COMPLETED` or
  `_HALTED`.

## What's intentionally NOT here

- **Coordinator-to-coordinator chaining** — deferred to v1.3.0+ if a
  real need surfaces.
- **Auto-write skill curation from loop runs** — operator chose
  suggest-only ([Skills auto-inject](24-skills-auto-inject.md)).
- **Cloud terminal backends** — violates rule #3. Won't ship.
